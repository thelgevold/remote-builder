# Example of building an Angular app with Bazel

**This is experimental! There may be breaking changes.**

This is part of the ABC project. The overall goal is to make it possible to
develop Angular applications the same way we do at Google.
See http://g.co/ng/abc for an overview.

You can read the documentation in the wiki of this repository to understand how
this works.

Follow https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/19058 for updates.

## Installation

Install Bazel from the distribution, see [install] instructions.
On Mac, just `brew install bazel`.

Bazel will install a hermetic version of Node, npm, and Yarn when
you run the first build.

[install]: https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html

Also add `ibazel` to your `$PATH`:

```
yarn global add @bazel/ibazel
```

or

```
npm install -g @bazel/ibazel
```

## Setup

Before building the app, we install packages, just as with any npm-based development workflow.

```bash
$ yarn install
```

or 

```bash
$ npm install
```

For the time being, you need to run your locally installed `yarn` or `npm` to install dependencies
as shown above. This is because we pull down the `@bazel/typescript` bazel dependency from npm and
that dependency needs to be in place before we can build the project. We're investigating
how to resolve this bootstrapping issue so in the future you will be able run `bazel run :install` to
install your npm packages without needing a local installation of `node`, `yarn` or `npm`.

## Development

Next we'll run the development server:

```bash
$ ibazel run src:devserver
```

> The `ibazel` command is a "watch mode"
> for Bazel, which means it will watch any files that are inputs to the devserver,
> and when they change it will ask Bazel to re-build them. The devserver stays
> running, and when the re-build is finished, it will trigger the LiveReload in
> the browser.

This command prints a URL on the terminal. Open that page to see the demo app
running. Now you can edit one of the source files (`src/lib/file.ts` is an easy
one to understand and see the effect). As soon as you save a change, the app
should refresh in the browser with the new content. Our intent is that this time
is less than two seconds, even for a large application.

Control-C twice to kill the devserver and also stop `ibazel`.

## Testing

We can also run all the unit and e2e tests:

```bash
$ ibazel test ...
```

This will run all the tests.

In this example, there is a unit test for the `hello-world` component which uses
the `ts_web_test_suite` rule. There are also protractor e2e tests for both the
`prodserver` and `devserver` which use the `protractor_web_test_suite` rule.

You can also run these tests individually using,

```bash
$ bazel test //src/hello-world:test
$ bazel test //test/e2e:prodserver_test
$ bazel test //test/e2e:devserver_test
```

Note that Bazel will only re-run the tests whose inputs changed since the last run.

## Production

We can run the application in production mode, where the code has been bundled
and optimized. This can be slower than the development mode, because any change
requires re-optimizing the app. This example uses Rollup and Uglify, but other
bundlers can be integrated with Bazel.

```bash
$ ibazel run src:prodserver
```

### Code splitting

The production bundle is code split and the `/` and `/todos` routes
are lazy loaded. Code splitting is handled by the rollup_bundle rule
which now supports the new code splitting feature in rollup.

Note: code splitting is _not_ supported in development mode yet so the 
`//src:devserver` target does not serve a code split bundle. For this
reason, development and production use different main entry points
(`main.dev.ts` and `main.prod.ts`) and different root modules
(`app.module.dev.ts` and `app.module.prod.ts`). The only difference in
these entry points and modules is how the routes are setup, with production
setting up lazy loaded routes and development not.
